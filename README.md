# Uquery 
A very simple (react front end | supabase backend) application made by me in around Febraury 2023.
I tried making something similar to stackoverflow. Even making the slogan code-related instead of JQuery you have UQuery-"An Answer for 'U' and 'U'r Queries"
Deployed on netlify https://uquery.netlify.app/

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the project locally:

Clone the repository: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run the command git clone <https://github.com/fabianwolski/UQuery> to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace <repository URL> with the URL of the GitHub repository.

Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt, and run the command npm install to install the project's dependencies. Note that you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine to run this command.

Install React scripts: You will need to install the react-scripts package to run the project. To install react-scripts, run the command npm install react-scripts in your terminal or command prompt.

Start the development server: Once the dependencies are installed, run the command npm run start to start the development server. This will open the project in your default browser and allow you to see any changes you make in real time.

Make changes: Use your preferred text editor or IDE to make changes to the project code. Any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the development server running in your browser.
